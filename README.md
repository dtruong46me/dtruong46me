## Hi, I'm Dinh Truong ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a 3nd year student at **Hanoi University of Science and Technology**. I'm currently learning **Data Science and Artificial Intelligence**. I have experience in building AI/ML/DL/DS projects. I have participated in many projects on Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing,... and have an understanding of ML/DL models, frameworks *(like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Huggingface,...)*.
I am learning about Generative AI, Big Data, MLOps and I want to become a Data/AI Engineer in the future.
